We created an interactive online cinema website that enables users to explore, rate, and organize their favorite movies and TV series in a visually engaging and intuitive environment. Our team prioritized modern web design and accessibility, featuring a dark-themed interface, dynamic collections, and clearly categorized navigation for movies, series, and curated collections such as Marvel, DC, and John Wick.​

Our website allows users to view detailed pages for each title, including visuals, ratings, tags, duration, and release year. We implemented features for personal profiles, where users can adjust language settings, enable notifications, and select preferred themes. This personalization strengthens the overall experience, making browsing and interaction smooth and efficient.

To enhance engagement, our platform supports rating and reviewing content, building user-driven recommendations and feedback. The contact section connects visitors directly with the team, supporting inquiries and suggestions. Throughout development, we focused on responsive layout and cross-device compatibility to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile browsers.

Our project demonstrates teamwork, technical skill, and creativity, delivering a robust application that meets academic requirements while reflecting best practices in web development and user experience.
